🚗 Car Washing Simulation Using Stack (Python)

This project is a simple console-based simulation that demonstrates how a Stack (LIFO) data structure works in a real-life scenario of a car wash line. Cars are added to the line using push, and washed and removed using pop operations.

📌 Features

Add a car to the waiting line

Wash/remove the last car added

Display current cars in the line

Capacity handling (Full / Empty messages)

Easy menu-based interaction

🧠 Concepts Used
